Preambule:

BooProject setup - is just a single .vsix file.
Naturally, VSIX file is a common zip with a bunch of content files. Some of these files are necessary for installing an extension, such as extension.vsixmanifest or [Content_Types].xml.
You can learn more about packaging a vsix here:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff407026.aspx

When you execute a vsix file, the vsixinstaller utility unzips all files into a special extensions folder and adds a registry value that indicates that this extension is enabled. All other necessary registry actions are stored in a pkgdef file and will be implemented while launching an instance of the VS2010.
 

How to package BooProject.vsix:

1) Rebuild the project. Check in your project's properties page that vsix will be generated after a build.
2) Find just generated vsix file in bin/debug folder
3) Rename its extension to zip.
4) Unzip it to some temp folder
5) Add all necessary boo files to that folder:
 
WARNING!!!
Make sure that you got booc.exe file from SharpDevelop source. 
OR 
if you got this from the official site -> process it with coreflags.exe utility with /32BIT+ /Force flags. Corfalgs.exe can be found in "c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Bin\CorFlags.exe" folder

6)Make sure that these files already exist:
-extension.vsixmanifest
-boo.ico
-BooProject.pkgdef
-BooProject.dll
-[Content_Types].xml
-ProjectTemplates and ItemTemplates folders with templates inside
7)Replace [Content_Types].xml with file with the same name in SetupFiles folder.
8) Final step - zip this folder again and rename it back to .vsix extension.

Done!
