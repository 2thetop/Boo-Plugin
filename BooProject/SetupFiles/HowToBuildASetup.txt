Preambule:

BooProject setup - is just a single .vsix file.
Naturally, VSIX file is a common zip with a bunch of content files. Some of these files are necessary for installing an extension, such as extension.vsixmanifest or [Content_Types].xml.
You can learn more about packaging a vsix here:

When you execute a vsix file, the vsixinstaller utility unzips all files into a special extensions folder and adds a registry value that indicates that this extension is enabled. All other necessary registry actions are stored in a pkgdef file and will be implemented while launching an instance of the VS2010.
 

How to package BooProject.vsix:

1) Rebuild the project - that's all you need :)

Done!
